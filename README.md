This project contains 2 implementations of the part of the Huffman lossless compression algorithm regarding
the build of the frequency table of a binary or text file (see documentation).
One based on mmap and one based on filestreams. The two implementations are tested and compared with
tables and graphs of performance, acceleration and efficiency.
